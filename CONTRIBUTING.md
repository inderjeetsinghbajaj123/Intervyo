# Contributing to Intervyo

Intervyo is built with one goal:  
**simulate real interviews and give brutally honest feedback.**

If your contribution does not move the project closer to that goal, it will not be merged.

## 🚫 Before You Contribute

Do NOT open a PR if:
- You haven’t read the README
- You are adding features just to look fancy
- You are dumping AI-generated code without understanding it
- You are fixing formatting and calling it a contribution

This is not a playground repo.

Good contributions include:
- Improving interview realism
